## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript 
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Regular expression

### What I learned 

This challenge provided valuable practice for my coding skills, particularly in styling images, validation and regular expression and some semantic elements. 

```html
<figure class="cards">
  <figcaption class="bg-front">
         ... 
  </figcaption>
  <figcaption class="bg-back">
         ... 
  </figcaption>
</figure> 
```

``` css
.detail .form label input:hover,
.detail .form label input:focus {
  background-image: linear-gradient(white, white), linear-gradient(to right, var(--Linear-gradient));
  border: 2px solid transparent;
  background-origin: border-box;
  background-clip: padding-box, border-box;
} 
```

```js
function formatNumber(cardNumber) {
  let str = String(cardNumber);
  return str.replace(/(\d{4})/g, '$1 ').trim();
}
```
