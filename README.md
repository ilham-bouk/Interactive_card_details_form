## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### What I learned


```html
<figure class="cards">
  <figcaption class="bg-front">
         ... 
  </figcaption>
  <figcaption class="bg-back">
         ... 
  </figcaption>
</figure> 
```

``` css
.detail .form label input:hover,
.detail .form label input:focus {
  background-image: linear-gradient(white, white), linear-gradient(to right, var(--Linear-gradient));
  border: 2px solid transparent;
  background-origin: border-box;
  background-clip: padding-box, border-box;
} 
```

```js
function formatNumber(cardNumber) {
  let str = String(cardNumber);
  return str.replace(/(\d{4})/g, '$1 ').trim();
}
```
